# Data Recovery Investigation Results

## 🔍 CURRENT STATUS

### ✅ What's Working:
- **WAL Recovery**: 2 REDO operations applied correctly
- **Data Recovery**: Records restored to page 10 successfully
- **Page Structure**: DataPage with 2 records recovered

### ❌ What's Not Working:
- **Table Metadata Recovery**: "Loading 0 table records from system catalog"
- **Table Schema**: Table definition not found after restart
- **System Catalog**: No table records in system catalog page

## 📊 DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Data Recovery Evidence:
```
REDO recovery completed: 2 operations applied ✅
Page 10: Record Count: 2                      ✅
Data exists: Alice, Bob records recovered     ✅
```

### Table Metadata Problem:
```
Loading 0 table records from system catalog  ❌
Table does not exist                         ❌
```

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The issue is in the **table metadata persistence flow**:

1. **CREATE TABLE** calls `create_table_catalog()`
2. `create_table_catalog()` calls `write_system_table_record()`
3. `write_system_table_record()` should save to page 1 (system catalog)
4. **During recovery**, `init_system_catalog()` tries to load from page 1
5. **Problem**: Page 1 is empty - metadata not being saved correctly

## 🛠️ SPECIFIC ISSUE

The `write_system_table_record()` function is supposed to save table metadata to page 1, but:
- Either the write is not happening
- Or the write is not being persisted to disk
- Or the read during recovery is looking in the wrong place

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

Need to investigate:
1. **Is `write_system_table_record()` being called?**
2. **Is the data being written to page 1?**
3. **Is page 1 being marked dirty and flushed?**
4. **Is the recovery reading from the correct page?**

## 📋 CURRENT BEHAVIOR

**Before Shutdown:**
- Table created: ✅ "employees" table exists
- Data inserted: ✅ 2 records inserted with WAL logging
- SELECT works: ✅ Returns 2 rows correctly

**After Restart:**
- WAL recovery: ✅ 2 INSERT operations replayed
- Data recovered: ✅ Records exist in page 10
- Table metadata: ❌ "employees" table definition missing
- SELECT fails: ❌ "Table does not exist"

**The data is there, but the database doesn't know the table exists because the schema metadata wasn't persisted properly.**
