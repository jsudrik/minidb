# Large Scale Durability Status Report

## Current Status: PARTIAL SUCCESS

### ‚úÖ **Multi-Page Storage Implementation**
- **Storage System**: Successfully handles page overflow by allocating new pages
- **Page Linking**: Pages are properly linked together with next_page pointers
- **Large Insertions**: Can insert 50+ and 100+ records without errors
- **Original Data Access**: All records accessible during initial session

### ‚úÖ **Basic Recovery Functionality**
- **WAL System**: All INSERT operations generate WAL records
- **REDO Process**: Recovery system processes WAL records
- **First Page Recovery**: Records on the first page are consistently recovered
- **Data Display**: Recovered records display with correct formatting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Multi-Page Recovery Issue**
- **Problem**: Only records from the first page are recovered after restart
- **Evidence**: 
  - 50 records: Record1 recovered ‚úÖ, Record50 missing ‚ùå
  - 100 records: Record1 recovered ‚úÖ, Record100 missing ‚ùå
- **Root Cause**: Recovery system not properly traversing all pages during REDO

## Technical Analysis

### Storage Layer Status
```
‚úÖ insert_record(): Allocates new pages when current page is full
‚úÖ scan_table(): Traverses all pages in linked list during SELECT
‚úÖ Page Management: Proper page linking and allocation
```

### Recovery Layer Status
```
‚úÖ WAL Logging: All operations logged to WAL
‚úÖ REDO Phase: Processes WAL records
‚ö†Ô∏è Multi-Page REDO: Only restores to first page during recovery
‚ùå Page Traversal: Recovery doesn't follow page chains properly
```

## Test Results Summary

### 50 Records Test
- **Insertion**: ‚úÖ All 50 records inserted successfully
- **Original Access**: ‚úÖ Record1 and Record50 both accessible
- **Recovery**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Only Record1 recovered, Record50 missing

### 100 Records Test
- **Insertion**: ‚úÖ All 100 records inserted successfully  
- **Original Access**: ‚úÖ Record1 and Record100 both accessible
- **Recovery**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Only Record1 recovered, Record100 missing

## System Capabilities Verified

### ‚úÖ **Fully Functional**
1. **Multi-page storage allocation**
2. **Large-scale data insertion (50+ and 100+ records)**
3. **WAL logging for all operations**
4. **Basic recovery for first page**
5. **Proper data display and formatting**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Functional**
1. **Multi-page recovery** - Only first page recovered
2. **Complete data durability** - Partial data loss on restart

## Conclusion

**SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ACHIEVED**: The system successfully handles large-scale data storage and basic recovery. The core infrastructure for multi-page storage and WAL-based durability is operational.

**REMAINING ISSUE**: Recovery system needs enhancement to properly traverse and restore all pages in the page chain during REDO operations.

**Current Capability**: ‚úÖ **50+ and 100+ record storage with partial durability**
**Target Capability**: üéØ **Complete multi-page recovery for full durability**
